Frontend development is the first impression of your web application. Fast, responsive, and visually appealing websites convert visitors into customers.

## Why React & Next.js

- Component-based architecture for reusable code  
- Server-side rendering (Next.js) for SEO  
- High-performance and scalable UI  
- Easy integration with APIs and backend services  

## Essential Frontend Practices

1. Mobile-first responsive design  
2. Optimize assets and images for speed  
3. Use CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap  
4. Add animations with GSAP or Framer Motion  
5. Maintain clean, commented code for scalability
