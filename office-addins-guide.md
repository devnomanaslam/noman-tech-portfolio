## What Are Office Add-ins?

Office Add-ins are small applications that **run inside Office apps** and extend their functionality. They allow you to:

## Best Practices for Office Add-ins

1. **Keep the add-in lightweight** – large or slow add-ins reduce user adoption
2. **Ensure cross-platform compatibility** – test on Windows, Mac, and Web
3. **Error handling and logging** – handle exceptions gracefully
4. **Testing** – thoroughly test your add-in using Office 365 sandbox
5. **Security** – never store sensitive data in plain text
